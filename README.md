# WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM- EMBEDDED-C-CODE

In this project, an effort is made to move in the same direction by proposing a model for an automatic car wiper system that operates on sensing rain and snow on the windshield of a car. We develop a prototype for our idea by integrating a servo motor and raindrop sensor with an AT89C51 Microcontroller.
